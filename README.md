# THAT

THAT Conference Monorepo

## Welcome to _Building a Full Stack Web App_!

Today we are going to build a Single Page Application (SPA) using NextJS. Our application is inspired by THAT Conference and will involve a speakers, schedule, and about page in addition to a GraphQL API. NextJS will allow us to build a performant application out-of-the-box by utiliziing code splitting and server-side rendering.

### Getting Started

Our first step is to setup our development environment and perform a systems check. Please execute the following commands from your terminal:

```
$ node -v
v12.5.0
```

```
$ npm -v
6.9.0
```

Once you have confirmed that your environment is ready, you are ready to setup your application by installing dependencies and starting your application:

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ now dev
```

We will be test-driving our project using Cypress. Our final systems check will be to open Cypress and ensure the sample tests are passing:

```
npm run cypress:open
```
