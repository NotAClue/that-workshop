# THAT

THAT Conference Monorepo

## Welcome to _Building a Full Stack Web App_!

Today we are going to build a Single Page Application (SPA) using NextJS. Our application is inspired by THAT Conference and will involve a speakers, schedule, and about page in addition to a GraphQL API. NextJS will allow us to build a performant application out-of-the-box by utiliziing code splitting and server-side rendering.

### Getting Started

Our first step is to setup our development environment and perform a systems check. Please execute the following commands from your terminal:

```
$ node -v
v12.5.0
```

```
$ npm -v
6.9.0
```
